Linear Regression Code Challenge
    Simple linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used to quantify the relationship between two variables. It allows us to predict an outcome (dependent variable) based on the value of one predictor (independent variable).
    
    In this challenge, we will apply simple linear regression to understand how different environmental factors affect the standardised yield of crops.

Our insights will not only help local farmers maximise their harvests but also contribute to the sustainable agriculture practices in Maji Ndogo.
